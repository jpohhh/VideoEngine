At this point, this is being left up for vanity purposes. The work for this project educated me on the basics of version control, shell scripts, and got me interested in building things using programming again. 4 years later, I have a business that employs ten people based on code I've written. Which is friggin' awesome! But, again, this code is old and near useless I imagine.
